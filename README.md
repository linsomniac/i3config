Features of my config:

- You will need to change the xrandr at the end, it sets up my specific displays.

- Uses Windows key as modifier.

- Uses vi motion keys.

- I have Mod+m and a letter mark a window and Mod+n jump to the marked windows.

- I use gnome screen saver, because the i3lock often gets into weird states
  and provides very little feedback.  Though when I close the lid on my
  laptop it still uses the i3lock instead of gnome screensaver, haven't
  figured that out yet.

- Mod+minus does the scratchpad, so Mod+minus will show/hide, Mod+Shift+minus
  will move a window to the scratchpad, and Mod+Ctrl+minus will go into
  scratchpad mode.  I currently only have one letter mapped in scratchpad
  mode, "d", for the only window I'm using in scratchpad mode.
